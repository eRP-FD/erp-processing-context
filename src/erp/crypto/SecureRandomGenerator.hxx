/**
 * The purpose of this class is the seeding of the internal state of the pseudorandom number
 * generator (PRNG) maintained by the OpenSSL library which is used in our code. We are requiring
 * that the PRNG is seeded, with data that has a sufficient amount entropy, so that the random
 * numbers (bytes) generated were of high quality even if the internal entropy pool of OpenSSL
 * had an initial entropy of 0.
 *
 * GS-A_4367 in gemSpec_Krypt_V2.15.0 requires to provide at least 120 bits of entropy.
 * This is ensured in the definitions of the ClientConfiguration class, which the client is
 * required to use in order to get a valid session. The entropy is calculated in this class.
 * Adding seed data also updates the seed data for the next client session.
 *
 * About the algorithmic recommendations specified by the BSI in the schema AIS-20:
 *
 * OpenSSL's implementation adheres to the guidelines in NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1, which in turn is
 * recommended by the BSI, as far as the generation of random numbers in concerned.
